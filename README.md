# Parabola Equation Solver
My first real project made in HTML/CSS/JS. Did it for a school project.
## Description

<ul>
<li>This is a HTML/CSS/JS program that solves equations for parabolas based on user input</li>
<li>There are three methods present in the project: Three points, Vertex and point, Point and zeroes</li>
<li>Uses Desmos API to graph the parabolas and equations</li>
<li>Includes a very very minor info page, just for fun</li>
</ul>

## How to run
Open the 'index.html' file by double clicking it <br> **or** <br> right-click it, then choose 'Open'
<br> <br>
if all goes well it should open up in your browser and you can use it from there
<br> <br>
***DO NOT*** move any files around the downloaded folder or outside of the downloaded folder. This will break the program.

## MAC users
This program will not work in Safari <br> If it forces you into Safari after you open it, copy the url from the top of the page and paste it into the search bar of another browser, such as Google Chrome <br> The program should be able to run properly from there
