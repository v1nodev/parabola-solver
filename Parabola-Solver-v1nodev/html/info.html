            There was nothing particularly special about this method. It's just give three points and let the program solves the system of equations.

            The equation for this method was far too big and all over the place to put here.
            <br><br><br><br><br><br>
            Also it used matrices and determinants to verify inputs.</p>

            This method requires the user to know what the vertex of a parabola is. That's about it.

            This method is identical to the Three Points Method if you take out the requirement for two of the points to be zeroes. The reason this method was created was both for some slight variation but also for user visuals. This method visually shows how these points are important. Just a little tidbit of information about this one. (Also the main reason this info page was made)
